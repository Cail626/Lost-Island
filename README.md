# Minecraft adventure map - Lost Island (alpha version, for minecraft 1.20, minecraft JAVA ONLY)

Thank you for wanting to play!

In this gitlab you will find 2 files: 
- "Lost island map": the minecraft map
- "lost_island_resourcepack": the minecraft ressource pack needed to play the game

On how to install a resource pack, I recommend the minecraft.fandom.com tutorial: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Loading_a_resource_pack

On how to install a minecraft map, I also recommend the minecraftmaps.com tutorial: https://www.minecraftmaps.com/info/how-to-install-a-minecraft-map
