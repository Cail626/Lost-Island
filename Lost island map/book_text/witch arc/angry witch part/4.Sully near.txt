What is that giant zombie doing there!?

(Jean) 

He seems quite strong.

(Sandra) 

Shuuut! He is sleeping. Just go away and come back when he woke up!

(Jean)

How much time do we need to wait before he wakes up? 

(Sandra)

Not very long. Just one month or two. Sully has been working on a new room for quite a
long time, he need to sleeps a little.

(You)

Just at the place were we want to put those items!? Look we accomplished all challenges and this big ass doesn't want to move so can we go?

(Sandra) 

Yes I understand the problem. It is something that I clearly didn't anticipate... We make whole mess and now my hosts cannot finish their task... What a problem...

(You)

We don't have all day!

(Sandra)

You are so impatient... So weak... And yet you bark so much... Are you compensating something? :)

(You)

Shut the fuck up!

(Sandra)

Hooo... I see... If you want to put those items on the altairs feel free to wake sully up but I am sad
that I risk to not hear you bark anymore... 

Hahaha show me if you can fight as well as you bark Marco!!!
