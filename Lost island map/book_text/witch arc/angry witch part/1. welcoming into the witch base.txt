(YOU)

Argh. I am feeling nauseous. Were are we? What is this place? Where is Christopher?

(Jean)

I don't know... I don't remerber seeing this place before... Blob... Just can you let me on the ground please... I think I will throw up.

(You)

Wait do not do it on me ok I will place near a corner... HA!(nearly fell into a hole) 

(Jean)

Perfect a hole... Blob... Just at the right moment...

(???)

If you seek Christopher, he is still inside the island's house. 

(You)

(Jean)

Blob

(???)

Let me present myself. I am a Sandra. I am the bulter of Nathalie. I am here to answer all of your questions and to explain to you what will happend. 
The two of you will be playing a little game. 

(You) 

( What is happening!? I think I lost consciousnessand and now I am in this strange place. I don't like being toyed like 
that... Fuck why I am doing this I need to get to the bottom of the lake and play games with a psycho witch and this bulter.
I fell like if I try to fight her she will kill me on the spot.)

(Jean)

*murmur let's do what they said otherwise we will get killed we don't have a choice

(You)

*murmur yeah figure. 

(Sandra) 

I know that you are feeling puzzled, let me clear your mind. You made the mistake of freeing Christopher and you need to pay it. 
At first we wanted to torture you for all the eternity but you should be thankfull, the witch took quite a liking to you and 
wants to offer you a last chance to redeem ourselves.

(You)

This is insane. 

(Sandra) 

I know, to us you are just like ants that we can crush however we like. By looking at how weak you are even if you didn't encountered us. You woudn't have lived long...
This island is a nightmare, taking the humanity of all the poeple that lived there... Including me :)

(You)

...

(Jean)

Stop this. I know that Marco can do it! We will complete your game and return to the Island.

(Sandra)

That's the spirit! Before explaining the rules, to help you in this game, I gladly offer you the content of the chest next to you.
Also do not hesitate to take stuff in the differents chest that you will find upside there are a lot of stuff that will help you a lot. 
Sooooo Let's get to the fun part. You are inside a mansion surrounded by 4 buildings. Each one of these contains a challenge. Once the 
challenge is finished you will find an item that you need to put on the altair at the right place and then we will let you go back :)

And I almost forgot to mention
there are a lot's of monsters that will fight you during that time so don't be too slow. 

(Jean)

Marko... We need to do it... 

(You) 

...(Inhale deeply) Let's go.
